# TREASUREHUNT

> John Kotz, Abby Starr, Yixuan He, Shouqi Chen

## Description

Treasure Hunt is a scavenger hunt game app which allows users to complete activities and complete a hunt through their phones. The Treasure Hunt app includes a variety of clues (e.g. Sudoku, Crosswords, etc.); users are presented with subsequent clues after completion of the original clue. The treasure hunts can be used for a variety of purposes, such as teaching people about the history of a location, letting individuals explore an area, etc. (e.g. Dartmouth administration creating a scavenger hunt for new students to get more accustomed to the campus).

## Progress
### Spring 16
In the fall we planned out the structure of the app and decided on the design of the app. Then we built the first version of the app. This included creating a login screen, a view to show the current hunts and the ability to complete a hunt by finishing all the clues.

Summary:

* Made a plan for what features would be in the app and how
* Designed the app
* Created first prototype
* Tested in public setting
* Released on TestFlight

### Summer 16
Now that we have the first prototype, we need to take a step back and take a better look at the structure of the database for scalability and at the design of the app. Once we fix those up, we can move on to the next features:

1. More clue types (Sudoku and Crossword)
2. Feed of global activity (since we don’t have friends implemented just yet)
3. The beginning of the clue creation feature
4. User functions (forgot password, set name, saving profile…)
